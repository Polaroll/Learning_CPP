# Overview

This software is an inventory tracking system. It breaks down items into major categories, then keeps track of the items information. That information includes giving it an ID, name, quantity, and a description. This program is similar to what you would find in a store like Target or Walmart.

My purpose for writing this software was to become familiar with C++ and it's syntax. I also wanted to create a software that I could use at home to keep track of items in my basement, such as food storage, camping gear, etc.

# Development Environment

I used GitHub to keep track of version control during development when I accidentally created broken code that I could not seem to fix. I also used Xcode as my IDE for this project.

The programming language I used was C++.
